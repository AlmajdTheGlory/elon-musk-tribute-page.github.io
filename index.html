                            <p> Entrepreneur Elon Musk has achieved global fame as the chief executive of electric autos maker Tesla Inc. (TSLA), the CEO and lead designer of his space company SpaceX, and, more recently, as the world's richest human.
                                Musk co-founded PayPal (PYPL), was an early investor in Tesla, and in April 2022 negotiated a deal to take Twitter Inc. (TWTR) private. </p>

                            <p> Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, the oldest of three children. His father was a South African engineer, his mother a Canadian model and nutritionist.
                                After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived primarily with his father. He would later dub his father "a terrible human being… almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."</p>

                            <p> Technology became an escape for Musk. At 10, he became acquainted with programming using a Commodore VIC-20, an early and relatively inexpensive home computer. Before long, Musk had become proficient enough to create Blastar—a video game in the style of Space Invaders. He sold the BASIC code for the game to a PC magazine for $500.
                                In one telling incident from his childhood, Musk and his brother, planned to open a video game arcade near their school. Their parents nixed the plan.</p>

                            <p> At 17, Musk moved to Canada. He would later obtain Canadian citizenship through his mother.
                                After emigrating to Canada, Musk enrolled in Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. It was there that he met Justine Wilson, an aspiring writer. They would marry and have five sons together, twins and triplets, before divorcing in 2008.</p>
